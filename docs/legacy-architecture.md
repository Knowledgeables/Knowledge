## Legacy Architecture
This legacy system is implemented as a monolithic Flash application.

All functionality is within a single deployable unit.

The different layers as routing, security business logic and database access are tightly coupled.

## Limitations
-Tight coupling between components.

-Limited test implemented

-Difficult to add new features without changing already existing code.

-No abstraction with between layers. No interfaces for abstraction.
